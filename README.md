# Predicting-stock-prices-using-Linear-Regression
This repository contains the code for predicting stock prices for 35 days into the future using Multivariate Linear Regression on wiki EOD stock price data by Alphabet, available on quandle.<br/><br/>The code predicts the stock prices and plots a graph between the dates and stock prices including the already trained data and the predicted data. The code contains self-explanatory comments to help the reader to understand the code.<br/><br/>Note that I have used my own api key. If this code doesn't work for you, I suggest you to generate your own api key on quandle to get it working.
